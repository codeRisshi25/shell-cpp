Hello Devs ! Just shipped my latest side-project Meow Shell (mshell).MShell is a modern, feature-rich POSIX-compliant shell implementation written in C++23 that provides a complete terminal environment with advanced interactive capabilities. The project demonstrates sophisticated systems programming concepts including raw terminal control, process management, and custom data structures. Key features include intelligent tab completion powered by a trie-based command indexing system that supports both built-in commands and PATH discovery, comprehensive command history with arrow key navigation, full I/O redirection support (>, >>, 2>, etc.), real-time line editing with backspace handling, and a robust finite state machine tokenizer that accurately parses complex command structures with proper quote handling and escape sequence support. The shell employs modern C++ design patterns with a modular architecture separating concerns into specialized components for tokenization, command execution, built-in command handling, and terminal management. Built from scratch without external shell libraries, MShell showcases low-level Unix system programming including file descriptor manipulation, process forking, signal handling, and termios-based terminal control, making it both a functional shell environment and an educational example of systems-level C++ development.
